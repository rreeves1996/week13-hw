This project was created by Ryan Reeves - click [here](mailto:ryan_reeves@live.com) to email the creator

## Project Description
This application utilizes sequelize in order to manage a database using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). It runs off a Node server, has fully functioning seeds/seeding, and accurately simulates (and could be used for) the back end of an E-Commerce database. It has functional GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes for each api route.

## Usage
First, add your dot env file with your desired database and username/password. Then, SOURCE the schema through mysql. From there, you can either start the server with your own seeds/database, or use npm run seed to seed with the provided seeds. Then, input node server/npm start to start the server.
